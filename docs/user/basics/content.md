# Managing your content

This page displays various ways of altering what Uni-VCC repository delivers to your Creator Companion.

The repository within VCC may take up to 5 minutes to refresh.

## Package Management

Eventually if you keep activating more and more license keys on the platform you're going to run into a problem: there are too many!

That will definitely clutter up your VRChat Creator Companion.

To prevent that, you can hide distributables inside [`Manage Packages`](https://uni-vcc.app/dash/manage-packages) tab that you don't need right now, and they won't show up in your creator companion.

If you want them back, simply toggle them again.

## Extra Repositories

Uni-VCC offers a way to centralize many community repositories into one URL, (unintentionally) accelerating the load times of VRChat Creator Companion's "Manage Packages" tab, as well as re-adding all repositories much quicker.

Visit [`Extra Repositories`](https://uni-vcc.app/dash/ext-repositories) to opt-in to curated community repositories.

Additionally, if you feel like supporting the project, you can subscribe on [Patreon](https://uni-vcc.app/go/patreon), unlocking "Private Repositories".
You can embed any non-curated repository by URL. Depending on your tier, you will have 3-25 external repository URLs.
