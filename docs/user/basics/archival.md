# Package Archival

Eventually if you keep activating more and more license keys on the platform you're going to run into a problem: there are too many!

That will definitely clutter up your VRChat Creator Companion.

To prevent that, you can archive distributables inside [`Package Archival`](https://uni-v.cc/dash/tabs/purchase-archival) tab that you don't care about, and they won't show up in your creator companion.

If you want them back, simply click "Unarchive".
