This is required to provide authorized access to packages as well as link the license keys.

To create an account, simply [Sign In](https://uni-vcc.app/sign-in) using third party platform of your choice.

After signing in, you should see your [Dashboard](https://uni-vcc.app/dash).

There you can link other accounts to log into the same account, as well as a few other buttons.

After you're signed into your account, you will be able to use the platform as a user.
