# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Thanks for choosing Uni-V.CC!

This platform is intended to simplify avatar creation and asset management with help of [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/)!

## Demonstration

Below is a video of how Uni-V.CC functions, from creating an account to importing a prefab into Unity:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/73hGYcscOoI?si=qKDuWjDCofsmF1Zg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen/>

## What we do:
- Unify and channel your library of purchased assets into VRChat Creator Companion;
- Clean up `Assets` folder inside of your Unity project;
- Simplify upgrading avatars and prefabs; (This still relies on asset creators to update their prefabs responsibly)
- Copying materials and textures for prefabs into a fixed folder structure;
- Encourage use of prefabs and prefab variants to improve layering of things on your avatar as well as version management;

## What we don't do:
- Share creator's assets without their involvement;
- Avatar ripping / piracy;
- Sell you assets directly;

Every package that you unlock must be activated with a valid license key from supported platform (ex. Gumroad, Jinnxy, itch.io) to appear in your Creator Companion.
