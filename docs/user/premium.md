Your contribution helps cover operational costs and enables us to keep building great tools for the community.

## 🎁 What You Get

By supporting us, you gain:

- Access to **exclusive Discord channels**
- Access to **private external repositories**  
  *(More details [here](./basics/content.md#extra-repositories))*

We’re always looking for new ways to add value to subscriptions — without taking anything away from free-tier users.

## 📌 Our Principles

When considering supporter-only features, we follow a few simple rules:

- ✅ Must be a **utility**, not something that degrades the free experience  
- 🔁 If part of the VPM repo, it must be **replaceable with free alternatives**  
- 💡 Must provide **real value** to our supporters

If you have an idea that meets these criteria, let us know via [email](mailto:hello@uni-v.cc) or [Discord](https://uni-vcc.app/go/discord)!  
We love hearing from the community.
